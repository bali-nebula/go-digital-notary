### Overview
This project implements a digital notary agent that can be used to digitally
sign documents containing
[Bali Document Notation™](https://github.com/bali-nebula/specifications/wiki/Language-Specification)
(or "Bali" for short). Each notarized document can then be validated using the
public certificate associated with the notary key used to sign the document.
