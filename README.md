## Go Digital Notary

### Overview
This project implements a digital notary agent that can be used to digitally
sign documents containing
[Bali Document Notation™](https://github.com/bali-nebula/go-bali-documents/wiki)
(or "Bali" for short). The notary seal on each notarized document can then be
validated using the public certificate associated with the notary key used to
sign the document.
