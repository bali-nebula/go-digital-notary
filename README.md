### Overview
This project provides a rich set of components that can be used to construct
[abstract syntax trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)
(ASTs) from documents containing _Bali Document Notation™_ (Bali for short). The
syntax trees can then be processed by agents like compilers, interpreters and
formatters for different document types (Bali, HTML, JSON, XML, etc.)
